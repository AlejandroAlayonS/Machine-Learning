    "        \n",
    "5. **Short-list promising models**\n",
    "    1. Train many quick and dirty models from different categories using standard parameters.\n",
    "    2. Measure and compare their performance\n",
    "        1. For each model use N-fold cross-validation and compute the mean and standard deviation of the performance measure on the N folds\n",
    "    3. Analyze the most significant variables for each algorithm\n",
    "    4. analyze the types of erros the models make\n",

    "    6. Short-list the top three to five most promising models, preferring models taht make difderent types of errors\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",

    "        1. Treat your data transformation choices as hyperparameters, especially when you are not sure about them\n",
    "        2. Unless there are very few hyperparameter values to explore, prefer random search over grid search. If training is very long, you may prefer a Bayesian optimization approach\n",
    "    2. Try Ensamble methods. Combining the best models will oftes perform better\n",
    "    3. Once you are confident about your final model, measure its performance on the test set to esimate the generalization error\n",

    "        1. Describe what work an what did not\n",
    "        2. List your assumptions and your system's limitations\n",
    "    5. Ensure your key findings are communicated through beautiful visualizations or easy-to-remember statements\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "8. **Launch, monitor and mantain your system**\n",
    "    1. Get your solution ready for production (plug into production data inputs, write unit tests, etc.).\n",
    "    2. Write monitoring code to check your system’s live performance at regular intervals and trigger alerts when it drops.\n",
    "        1. Beware of slow degradation too: models tend to “rot” as data evolves.\n",
    "        2. Measuring performance may require a human pipeline (e.g., via a crowdsourcing service).\n",
    "        3. Also monitor your inputs’ quality (e.g., a malfunctioning sensor sending random values, or another team’s output becoming stale). This is particularly important for online learning systems.\n",
    "    3. Retrain your models on a regular basis on fresh data (automate as much as possible)."
